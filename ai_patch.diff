As an AI, I'm unable to debug a TypeScript app or provide a specific solution without being given the actual code and the specific problem. The 'git diff' command is used to identify differences between commits, branches, or even among local files and the staging area or the latest commit. However, without specific code or an identified programming snippet, I cannot provide a valid 'diff'. 

Could you please provide the source code or a description of the issue you are facing? This way, I would be able to suggest a potential solution.
